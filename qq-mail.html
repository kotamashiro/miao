  <div>Glad you asked. The effect demonstrated here is achieved by using fixed background images, nothing more. For
    example, the main-content area (the blue part here) uses the following styles for the default spiral-shell
    background:

    div#content {background: white url(glassy-ripple.jpg) 0 0 no-repeat fixed;}
    The above is equivalent to these styles:

    div#content {
    background-color: white;
    background-image: url(glassy-ripple.jpg);
    background-position: 0 0;
    background-repeat: no-repeat;
    background-attachment: fixed;
    }
    The effect of these longer rules is exactly the same; they're just split out into individual background properties
    for more detailed consideration by you, gentle reader.

    First, check out the rippled-shell image found here: url(glassy-ripple.jpg). Then come back to this page and I'll
    continue with the explanation. All done? Great.

    According to CSS, any background image that is "fixed" using background-attachment: fixed; is fixed with respect to
    the viewport-- not the element with which the image is associated. So I set the rippled-shell background image to be
    aligned with the top left corner of the browser window (the viewport) with the values given for background-position.
    However, the image will only be visible wherever is intersects with the element to which it's been assigned.
    Therefore, even though the top left corner of the rippled-shell image is aligned with the top left corner of the
    viewport, we can only see it wherever it intersects with a div that has an id with a value of content (which, again,
    happens to be the one containing this text). According to CSS, any background image that is "fixed" using

    So I set a fixed background for the BODY, the content DIV, and H1 and H2 elements scattered through the document. In
    any given case of an element's display, we see whatever part of the associated background image intersects with the
    element. The rest of the background image remains hidden.
